\section{Molecular Dynamics Simulators}
\subsection{Introduction}
Molecular dynamics is the study of the movement of particles, this is usually done using computer simulations.  There are two main methodologies used to simulate the motion of particles: force (or time) driven or event driven simulators.
\subsection{Force-Driven Simulators}
Force driven simulators move through time in small steps ($\Delta t$) where a particle's new position is calculated from its previous position and velocity, along with the forces acting on that particle. \\
The equation at the heart of force driven simulators is Newton's Second Law of Motion (equation \ref{eq:fma}), where the acceleration can be written as the second derivative of position with time. 

\begin{equation}
F=ma=m\frac{\partial^2r}{\partial t^2} \ref{eq:fma}
\end{equation}

The problem therefore is how to calculate the position from its second derivative, to do this integrators are used.  There are a large number of integrators used in simulators but most of these are derived from Taylor Series (equation \ref{eq:taylor}).  The simplest of these is Euler's Method, which is a Taylor series truncated after the second derivative.  

\begin{equation}
r(t+\Delta t)=r(t)+\frac{\partial r}{\partial t}\Delta t+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 r}{\partial t^2}\Delta t^2+\frac{1}{3!}\frac{\partial^3 r}{\partial t^3}\Delta t^3+... \ref{eq:taylor}
\end{equation}
