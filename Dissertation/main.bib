  pages = {4307},
  abstract = {Argon, represented as a Lennard-Jones fluid, is simulated using a
	discontinuous version of the potential. The effect of discretization
	is thoroughly investigated in terms of the number of discontinuities
	and the cutoff diameter. Radial distribution functions, pressure,
	energy, self-diffusion coefficients, and velocity autocorrelation
	functions are used in order to evaluate this effect. A reduction
	of five times on computing time can be achieved by varying the cutoff
	radius and the number of discontinuities without much departure from
	the physical representation of Lennard-Jonesium atoms. The results
	indicate that discontinuous molecular dynamics is a viable alternative
	method to Monte Carlo and continuous molecular dynamics in simulating
	the properties of simple fluids. The Journal of Chemical Physics
	is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.},
