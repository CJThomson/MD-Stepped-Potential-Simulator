TODO for the soft potential simulator

* BUG FIXES [2/2]
** DONE Counter of the nubmer of collisions on each step is not working
** DONE Thermostat is not remaining on all the time
* MAINTANANCE [2/12]
** TODO Split up the program and make it more object orientated[0%]
   + [ ] change logging to set file name once on logger initialisation
   + [ ] make a scheduler class that handles all event list operations
   + [ ] make a property measurement class??
   + [ ] make a class to handle the CLI
   + [ ] make a class to handle particle pairs??
   + [ ] make a class to handle all the system properties??

** TODO Increase simulator performance [0%]
  + [ ] add a variable storing the last time a particle's position was updatated
  + [ ] calculate temperature from the kinetic energy
** TODO Only measure desired properties instead of everything
** DONE Change when measuring millions of collisions to M instead of k...etc
** TODO Add using time or events to end collisions
** TODO Add core selection to stepper
** TODO Add a special results folder for particular data run
** DONE Have a single equilibriation period per run
* NEW FEATURES [0/4]
** TODO Add Neighbourlist [0%]
+ [ ] Change neighbourlist implementation
      1. calculate current step 
      2. calculate when a particle leaves the cell and which cell it is going to, store this
      3. on cell move event, move the particle into its new cell
+ [ ] Add overlapping NL cells
** TODO Allow the use of script files
** TODO Add progress file to view progress when running through ssh
** TODO Add Collision rate statistics
