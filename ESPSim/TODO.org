** TODO Possible negative time interval: - confirmed
   Only happens with particles 0 or 1, check initialisation of the
   particles, try changing the loop to loop from 0 to numParticles
   Hopefully this should fix the problem...but why are iterators not
   working????? Maybe have it output all the particles' initial
   positions and velocities and check they all have them...
